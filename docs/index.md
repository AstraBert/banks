# Welcome to Banks

[Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)) is the linguist professor who will help you generate meaningful
LLM prompts using a template language that makes sense.

## Features

* Based on Jinja2, Banks currently supports all its features. See [Template Designer Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#jinja-filters.truncate).
* Filters: useful to manipulate the text during template rendering.
* Extensions: useful to support custom functions (e.g. text generation via OpenAI).
* Macros: useful to implement complex logic in the template itself instead of Python code.
